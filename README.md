Task Management System

This project is a practical test for developing a Task Management System using C#. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, with all data being stored in a JSON file.

Features
Task Listing: Displays a list of all tasks, showing their title, description, and status.
Task Creation: Enables the addition of new tasks with a title, description, and status.
Task Update: Allows for the editing of existing tasks, including the updating of the title, description, and status.
Task Deletion: Provides the functionality to delete tasks from the list.


Optional Features (Not Implemented)
Filters and Sorting: The ability to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria (e.g., status, creation date) was planned but is not implemented in this version.
Unit Tests: While unit tests for the main functionalities were desired, they are not included in this version of the project.
